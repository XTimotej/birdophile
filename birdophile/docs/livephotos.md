Based on my analysis of the camera service code, let me provide insights on the two approaches you're considering:

## Current Architecture Analysis

The system uses a contour-based motion detection algorithm with several filters to reduce false positives. When motion is detected:
1. First it captures a still image
2. Then it records a video for 5 seconds (VIDEO_DURATION = 5)
3. The camera is closed and reopened between these operations

The key issue is the timing - by the time the system finishes capturing the image and starts recording video, the birds have already left.

## Evaluation of Your Options

### Option A: Optimize the current approach
The delay is primarily caused by:
- Processing time between motion detection and image capture
- The camera.close() and re-initialization between still image and video
- External shell script launch for video recording

Optimizing these steps could reduce the delay but likely not enough for quick bird visits.

### Option B: "Live Photos" continuous buffer approach
This is the better solution for your use case. Instead of starting a video after detection, you'd maintain a rolling buffer of recent frames and save those when motion is detected.

## Implementation Recommendation

I recommend Option B with these specific adaptations:

1. Create a circular buffer that continuously stores the last 5-10 seconds of video frames
2. When motion is detected, save the buffer (which contains the pre-motion footage)
3. Continue recording for your desired additional time after motion

This approach would give you "video from the past" capturing the bird's entry, similar to security camera pre-recording or dashcam footage.

The main challenge will be managing memory efficiently while maintaining the video buffer, but the picamera2 library does support this pattern through its circular buffer functionality.
